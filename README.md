## Titanic Surviver Classification
It is purposed to show a basic example of an anaylsis of Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster in Python. This notebook includes three parts.
### Data handling
 - Import data with Pandas
 - Cleaning the data and extract valid features
 - Exploring data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
### Data anaylsis 
 - Apply supervised Machine learning models:
   1. Logistic Regression
   2. K-nearest neighbour Algorithm
   3. Multi-layer Perceptron
### Valuation of the anaylsis
 - K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
 - Upload the predict result to the Kaggle
