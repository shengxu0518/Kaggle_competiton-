## Titanic Surviver Classification
It is purposed to show a basic example of an anaylsis of Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster in Python. This notebook includes three parts.
### Data handling
 - Import data with Pandas
 - Cleaning the data and extract valid features
 - Exploring data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
### Data anaylsis 
 - Apply supervised Machine learning models:
   1. Logistic Regression
   2. K-nearest neighbour Algorithm
   3. Multi-layer Perceptron
### Valuation of the anaylsis
 - K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
 - Upload the predict result to the Kaggle
 
## AirBNB User Booking Interest Prediction
It is aimed to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking. the dataset is provided by Kaggle.com
### Data handling
 - Import data with Pandas
 - Cleaning the data and extract valid features
 - Exploring data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
### Data anaylsis 
 - Apply supervised Machine learning models:
  1. Random Forest Algorithm 
  2. Add Adaboost Classifier on Random Forest
### Valuation of the anaylsis
 - K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
 - Upload the predict result to the Kaggle
 
## What's Cooking 
 the purpose is to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients. The unique dataset is provided by Yummly.
### Data handling
 - import data with json
 - create a matrix for each train data and test data,each ingredient appeared will be represent 1 in the matrix 
 
### Data anaylsis 
 - Apply supervised Machine learning models:
   1. Logistic Regression
